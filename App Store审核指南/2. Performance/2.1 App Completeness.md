### Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness

```
We found that your in-app purchase products exhibited one or more bugs when reviewed on iPhone running iOS 10.3.3 on Wi-Fi connected to an IPv6 network.

Specifically, an error message displayed after IAP purchase is completed.
Next Steps

When validating receipts on your server, your server needs to be able to handle a production-signed app getting its receipts from Apple’s test environment. The recommended approach is for your production server to always validate receipts against the production App Store first. If validation fails with the error code “Sandbox receipt used in production,” you should validate against the test environment instead.
```

这个看到IPv6 network 不要以为是IPv6的问题,仔细看Next steps中的描述 `If validation fails with the error code “Sandbox receipt used in production,” you should validate against the test environment instead`  也就是如果验证失败，并出现错误代码“生产中使用的沙盒收据”，则应该针对测试环境进行验证。简单说就是审核期间,内购的验证要先去测试正式环境验证,如果有错误代码就要去测试沙盒地址验证!

我曾在[iOS开发-2017苹果内购最新教程](http://www.jianshu.com/p/adaf472ed3ab)写到过这个问题,但是服务器端的同学为避免测试任务误操作,所以去掉了验证!/(ㄒoㄒ)/~~

> 我们项目中有花苞这个虚拟币的概念! 这是被拒了第二次,之前通过解决方案中心进行了回复顺利审核了,这次又被拒!建议在每次审核的备注中添加上花苞的获取方式! 同理上面的网络文化许可证的问题,也在附件中添加上,避免每次因为同样的问题被拒,浪费时间


### Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed

问题描述：
```
This type of app has been identified as one that may violate one or more of the following [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/). Specifically, these types of apps often:

1.1.6 - Include false information, features, or misleading metadata
2.3.0 - Undergo significant concept changes after approval
2.3.1 - Have hidden or undocumented features, including hidden "switches" that redirect to a gambling or lottery website
3.1.1 - Use payment mechanisms other than in-app purchase to unlock features or functionality in the app
3.2.1 - Do not come from the financial institution performing the loan services
4.3.0 - Are a duplicate of another app or are conspicuously similar to another app
5.2.1 - Were not submitted by the legal entity that owns and is responsible for offering any services provided by the app
5.2.3 - Facilitate illegal file sharing or include the ability to save, convert, or download media from third party sources without explicit authorization from those sources
5.3.4 - Do not have the necessary licensing and permissions for all the locations where the app is used

Before we can continue with our review, please confirm that this app does not violate any of the above guidelines. You may reply to this message in Resolution Center or the App Review Information section in App Store Connect to verify this app’s compliance. 

Given the tendency for apps of this type to violate the aforementioned guidelines, this review will take additional time. If at any time we discover that this app is in violation of these guidelines, the app will be rejected and removed from the App Store, and it may result in the termination of your Apple Developer Program account.

Should you choose to resubmit this app without confirming this app’s compliance, the next submission of this app will still require a longer review time. Additionally, this app will not be eligible for an expedited review until we have received your confirmation.
```

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise or remove this content from your app's metadata. For resources on metadata best practices, you may want to review the App Store Product Page information available on the Apple developer portal.

Since your iTunes Connect status is Metadata Rejected, we do NOT require a new binary. To revise the metadata, visit iTunes Connect to select your app and revise the desired metadata values. Once you’ve completed all changes, reply to this message in Resolution Center and we will continue the review.

NOTE: Please be sure to make any metadata changes to all app localizations by selecting each specific localization and making appropriate changes.

Guideline 2.3.8 - Performance - Accurate Metadata
We noticed that your app icons, screenshots, or other metadata items include content that is not appropriate for all age groups. Specifically, your screenshots contain content and image objectifying female.
Please see attached screenshots for details.
Next Steps
To resolve this issue, please revise your metadata to ensure that all items are appropriate for a 4+ age rating. Since this content is visible on the App Store by all users, even when purchasing is restricted by the app's rating, this content must meet the requirements for a 4+ rating.

或许你有疑惑,我的APP等级分级是17+,而屏幕截图却需要4+的等级限制!  这是因为你的APP分级是下载的分级限制,你的评估截图展示出来的是任何人都可以访问到的!所以必须适合4+的分级限制

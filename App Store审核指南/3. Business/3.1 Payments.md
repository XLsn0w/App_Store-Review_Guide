Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase
We noticed that your app or its metadata enables the purchase of content, services, or functionality in the app by means other than the in-app purchase API, which is not appropriate for the App Store.
Specifically, your app enables points, or intermediate currencies, without using the in-app purchase API.
The next submission of this app may require a longer review time, and this app will not be eligible for an expedited review until this issue is resolved.
**Next Steps**
- Review the In-App Purchase section of the
 [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)

- Ensure your app is compliant with all sections of the

 [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) 

and the

 [Terms & Conditions](https://developer.apple.com/terms/) 

of the Apple Developer Program.

- Once your app is fully compliant, resubmit your app for review.

If you believe your app is compliant with the

 [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)

, you may submit an appeal. Alternatively, you may provide additional details about your app by replying directly to this message.

**In-App Purchase**

It may be appropriate to revise your app to use the in-app purchase API to provide content purchasing functionality.

In-app purchase provides several benefits, including:

- The flexibility to support a variety of business models.

- Impacting your app ranking by consolidating your sales to one app rather than distributing them across multiple apps.

- An effective marketing vehicle to drive additional sales of new content.

For information on in-app purchase, please refer to the following documentation:

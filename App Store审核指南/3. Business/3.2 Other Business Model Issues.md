### Guideline 3.2 - Business
```
We found that your app is not appropriate for the World storefront because it is a custom app designed specifically for an organization, whose users are in China.

At this time, China is not part of the [Volume Purchase Program](https://www.apple.com/business/vpp/).

**Next Steps**

Please revise your app to set the storefront to China.

**Resources**


You can find additional information regarding the Volume Purchase Program and the Custom B2B Store in [App Store Connect Developer Help](https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev300c2c5bf).

Since your iTunes Connect status is Metadata Rejected, we do NOT require a new binary. To revise the metadata, visit iTunes Connect to select your app and revise the desired metadata values. Once you’ve completed all changes, reply to this message in Resolution Center and we will continue the review.

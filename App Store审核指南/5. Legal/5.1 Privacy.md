We noticed that your app does not obtain the user's consent prior to uploading users' scores to a global leaderboard.

To collect personal data with your app, you must make it clear to the user that their personal data will be uploaded to your server.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your app to include a privacy policy URL in the App Information page on iTunes Connect and ensure that the URL you provide directs users to your privacy policy.

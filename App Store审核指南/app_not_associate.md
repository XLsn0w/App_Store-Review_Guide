##解决方案:
[Apple Developer Program License Agreement](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Documentation/License_Agreements__Apple_Developer_Program/Apple_Developer_Program_License_Agreement_20160921.pdf),

1、Vendor Email(app 提供商的邮箱,最好和app的名字看起来关系),Support UR app的卖主提供的支持网址：(填公司网址即可,金融类的最好填金融类的,比如中国银行最好填中国银行的网址,不要填和中国银行一点关系都没有的外包公司的网址）
2、App中相关的内容一定要体现出公司相关的内容，千万不能让苹果审核者以为你这个App和你们公司没什么关系，那肯定会被拒。
3、把开发者邮箱修改下，里边把名称修改成公司名称
4,Seller and Artist names  卖app的人(免费下载其实也叫卖,0元卖),
